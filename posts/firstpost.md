<p>This is a post on My Blog about the first challenge given to me by CodersGuild on JAMStack Bootcamp.<br>
The challenge was to:
'Build the table as shown in the image. <br>When properly and semantically marked up you do not need classes to style as required.'
</p>
<h3><a href="/challenges/html-table/">Link to the table</a></h3>
